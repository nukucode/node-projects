## About

Node.js is an open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime that allows developers to build scalable, high-performance network applications. With its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, Node.js is particularly well-suited for building real-time applications, APIs, and web servers.

Node.js projects encompass a wide range of applications and use cases, making it a versatile technology for web and server-side development. Here are some key aspects of Node.js projects:
